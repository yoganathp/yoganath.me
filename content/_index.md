Seeking Dynamic Role in Embedded Systems Development
{{< /alert >}}

<br>

Hello, I'm Yoganath P, a B. Tech graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2023) from Pondicherry Engineering College. I am passionate about embedded systems and their multiple applications in the real world.

During my undergraduate studies, I actively contributed to the [Atal Incubation Centre - PEC Foundation](http://www.aicpecf.org/) as an intern, working on a sponsored start-up project by [AICTE](https://www.aicte-india.org/) & [MOE Innovation Cell](https://www.mic.gov.in/).

In addition to my core curriculum, I've undertaken various projects to gain hands-on experience with microcontrollers.
